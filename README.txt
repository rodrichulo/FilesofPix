Currently our project accomplishes the following:
        * Successfully converts all corrupted pgm within the
        provided repository files into correctly formatted raw pgm files.
        * Frees all data allocated on the heap.
        * Can handle lines with the correct injection sequence, but 
        containing one or more numbers > 255.
        * Can handle lines containing injected null chars.
        * Correctly distinguishes between original lines and 
        injected corrupted lines.
        * Functions correctly when file is provided as command line arg 
        or in stdin.
        * Raises checked runtime error if:
                * more than one arg is supplied.
                * the named input cannot be opened.
                * error is encountered when reading from file.
                * a corrupted pgm is promised, but not supplied.
                * Memory cannot be allocated with malloc.
        * Things that don't work:
                * Not sure how to extensively check stdin or check that
                  fgetc from stdin would fail. 
Colloborations:
        During office hours we received help from Matt, Alec, Kenny, Kresten, 
        and MJ. Thank you Neil Powers for commenting on Piazza telling me
        to read the spec.
